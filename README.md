# about
An app that aims to increase youth political literacy in the US : ) 

This is a bit of what inspired us: 
While talking with our peers every day, we realized that even though a lot of us cared about the nation, we did not understand how it worked and what bills were being passed in Congress. We were unable to form opinions on American policy because we didn’t understand it! After looking further into this problem, we realized that 51% of youth use social media as their primary source of information, only 47% of youth voted in the last election, and more than 70% of Americans fail civic literacy tests! 
Realizing this was an essential large-scale problem that was not addressed by many sources (a lot of the legislation monitoring apps currently are for policymakers and lawyers), we focused on this idea for our Congressional App. We decided to break down the actual bills being passed in Congress: real bills are too hard to read due to their usage of legal language and lengthy structure, but they can be primary sources that people can trust. 
While researching, we also connected this problem to a famous book we had read for school, Animal Farm by George Orwell. This book had a scene in which the farm constituents could not read the rules anymore, and therefore stopped contributing to their farm in beneficial ways. Since the main idea of our app was to prevent this scene, we named our app Orwell.


What our app includes:
*ML that breaks down bills --> makes law readables
*Sentiment analysis pipeline we made --> can see what the media thinks of the law
*AI personal impact assessment --> how does the law affect YOU?
*Quizzes! --> for user interaction! 
*Animations and streaks and trumpet playing for you when you log in : )
